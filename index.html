            <h2>Hi, I'm Dan</h2>
            <p>
                I am 26 years old, and I am a part time student at UC studying a Bachelors in Digital Product Design,
                while
                working full time at
                ANZ New Zealand in IT Support.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've previously studied Web & UX Design at YooBee where my passion started. I've also spent time
                studying IT
                and Cookery (without much success due to past issues with mental health), after leaving study for 4
                years
                and focusing on work, I found my calling with UX/UI design, as I want to be able to use it as a platform
                to elicit change for the better, with better adoption of practices in design for people with
                disabilities.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my spare time I like to play games, and do creative things, however due to my lack of time from Study
                and
                Work I don't do much of this at the moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also hope to someday be able to open a Tabletop Cafe (Boardgame Cafe), but this is just a distant pipe
                dream.
