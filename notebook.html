                            In Week 1 we had Two Lectures, A Workshop and Computer Lab.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Workshop we performed an activity around collaboration and working together to solve
                            an
                            issue
                            under time
                            pressure, where we had to work together in small groups to identify how to solve a situation
                            where a
                            room had been
                            overbooked with three groups arriving in a short frame of time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Computer Lab we did some basic app / file setup with the tools we will use (Figma,
                            GitLab,
                            etc.) as well as an
                            introduction to Visual Studio Code and the basic setup of an HTML boilerplate.
                        <p>
                            We had two lectures this week, the first was focussed on 'Problem Solving and the How and
                            Why',
                            this
                            covered some
                            context around problem solving, as it was the first lecture of the semester it also covered
                            a
                            lot of
                            the basic
                            information around the course in general.
                            The second was focussed on 'Digital Products and Society', this covered the history of
                            Digital
                            Products
                            and
                            Technology. It also touched on where the User Interface came from and how it all started and
                            some
                            key
                            events
                            within history around the creation of UI and the introduction of computers to the masses.

                            We had two lectures this week, the first was focussed on 'The Psychology of Experience',
                            this
                            covered the framework for understanding design research and the various forms of
                            Experience
                            (Dynamic,
                            Complex, Subjective). It also took us through various aspects of experience the
                            Psychology behind it that as designers need to take into account.
                            The second was focussed on 'Document Structure', this covered basic document and
                            typography
                            structures of a website as well as various different aspects and considerations of web
                            design/development.

                        <p>
                            In Week 3 we had Two Lectures, A Workshop and Computer Lab.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Workshop we performed an activity where we were given a website and we
                            sitemapped
                            it as a
                            group. This involved creating a spreadsheet of all the links and different pages to
                            the
                            website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Computer Lab we focussed on fonts, and using Figma to play around with fonts
                            and
                            find
                            ones
                            we
                            like. We did this by finding a body and a header font then adjusting the weight,
                            style
                            (bold,
                            italic, etc.), and the line heights. You can see this below.

                            We had two lectures this week, the first was focussed on 'Information Architecture',
                            this
                            lecture focussed on 5 main points:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>1. Data vs Information</ol>
                        <ol>2. Wayfinding and Navigation</ol>
                        <ol>3. Sitemaps and App Structure</ol>
                        <ol>4. Classification and Labelling</ol>
                        <ol>5. Storage and Transformation</ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It touched on the histories and origins of each of these key points and some key
                            contextual
                            information around them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second lecture we had focussed on Fluid Typography. It discussed the origins of
                            typography
                            and
                            went through the history of it, to the point of where it is today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Amongst other things, the lecture also talked about:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>Digital Typeface Design</ol>
                        <ol>Phototypesetting</ol>
                        <ol>The Relationship of Musical Scales to Page Proportions</ol>
                        <ol>Modular Scales n UI Typography</ol>
                        <ol>Continuous Scaling vs Snapping to Breakpoints</ol>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Week 4 we had Two Lectures, A Workshop and Computer Lab.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Workshop we were introduced to our T3 Research Project, for this project we'll be
                            creating a
                            Research Project around one of two topics:
                        <P>
                        <ol>1. Student Note-Taking and Study Support</ol>
                        <ol>2. Science Communication and Hazard Awareness</ol>
                        </P>
                        <p>
                            I have opted to go for the first of the two options and have started working towards the
                            first
                            one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Computer Lab we focussed on colours and used https://colorbox.io/ to create a
                            colour
                            palette
                            then export that to figma.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We had two lectures this week, the first was focussed on 'Functional and Perceptual
                            Patterns'.
                        <p>
                            The second focussed on Colour Systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately due to course work for PROD101 and some personal obligations I haven't had
                            a
                            chance to
                            watch these lectures yet. I am hoping to catch up over the next week.

                            In the Workshop we focussed on Journey Mapping. We worked in groups to create  a journey map of a users journey for signing up for a website. In our case it was a fictional graphic design tool / Canva.

                        <p>
                            In the Computer Lab we looked at intrinsic layouts and worked on a lab activity to
                            design a
                            'card' in Figma, then replicate it in CSS/HTML, you can see this on this page, with the
                            new
                            layout. (～￣▽￣)～
